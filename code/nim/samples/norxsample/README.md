# A trivial sample using Norx
This is just a trivial port of the original ORX sample with a spinning logo.

# Install
First install Norx by running `nimble install` in `../norx`. Also **make sure you have `liborx[d|p].so` in a proper place, like /usr/lib/** (working dir doesn't work for me).

Then run `nimble install` in this directory. After that you can run `norxsample`.
